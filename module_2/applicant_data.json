I had a lot of experience in SLP related areas, but had a D in Stats when I first applied. I took another Stats course and got a B that I put down on the \"required courses\" section the second time round. In my gap year, I got a job as a Behaviour Interventionist, volunteered at a Brain Injury Society doing intake interviews with Brain Injury survivors, redid my letter of interest with a Career Advisor, and asked an SLP Alumni from U of A to write my reference letter. One of my referees wasn't able to get their reference letter in on time, and they still accepted my application with just 2 references. If you're applying to U of A for SLP my best advice is to job shadow as many SLPs as you can, try gaining work experience in related fields, and focus on your letter of interest and reference letters. Keep trying! If you don't get in this year, you'll probably get in next year!!",

Wrote twice in April to the contact email for MFA Creative Writing as I had other offers pending and needed to make a decision; one contact was via the portal, other via direct email, and still received no response. After May 1, thinking maybe I was on the wait list and they were waiting to see if a space opened up after others replied to offers, I finally contacted graduate admissions, who said the department had not yet notified them to send my decision, and they suggested I contact someone else in the Creative Writing department, which I did. Here was the response:  \"I'm sorry you have not received word from the Graduate School yet. Notices should have been sent out a month ago. Perhaps we have the wrong email address for you on file. I'm sorry to say that your application was not advanced to admission for the 2025 academic year. We hope you will consider reapplying next year and wish you the best of luck in all your future endeavors.\"  Bogus - they had my email on file and no notice was posted on portal. Glad I have another offer to accept and don't have to deal with a program that can't give the courtesy of a response to applicants after multiple attempts to get an answer on a decision.",

I saw there was a physics PhD rejection so I'm wondering if anyone else got deferred and if there might be a pathway to a MTU PhD. I'm still waiting to hear back from post-baccs and funded master's so my decision is still pending",

You should check your application portal to confirm whether you have received either of these notifications. If you did not receive either notification, then you were on our waitlist, and we were hoping to be able to admit you.   However, at this point, we have made all the offers we expect to make for the Fall 2025 semester. Due to the statewide hiring freeze by the governor of Louisiana, we will not be making any offers after April 12. The earliest we may resume the process is in July, barring any extensions of the hiring freeze.   I’ve accepted an offer at another school anyways but just wanted my answer. Best of luck to anyone else who is on the waitlist (?? at least I think I’m on the waitlist)  2a/9r/2w/0p",

This has been the hardest, saddest period of my life and I can't tell you how much getting accepted to Cornell will mean to me.  Not only is it close to my gf's but they have amazing faculty and I can literally work with atleast 3 faculty if I wanted to. If you’ve received an offer and have other options you’re planning to accept, please consider doing so. I know today is decision day, and every spot counts. Thank you and good luck to everyone, wherever you end up! Please accept other offers please",

The chair said there were financial concerns and were cutting admissions (combination of high admission rate last year and federal funding). I followed up on 4/14 in the morning and heard from the chair around 10 pm MDT that I will not be admitted. I'm very disappointed because my PI and I had been working together for over 6 months developing a research plan. We got along well and I was excited to work on the project.",

Although you were among our top candidates, we do not have enough positions available to offer you admission to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.   Graduate education is characterized by small classes and close mentoring by faculty. As a result, programs have only a limited number of available seats. Our decisions about who to admit are not made solely on the basis of the excellence of our applicants, but also with a consideration of whose work we can best support. Each year we receive many more applications than can be accommodated; consequently, we are unable to admit many highly qualified students.    Thank you again for your interest in the University of Virginia. We wish you the best of luck as you continue your pursuit of an advanced degree\"",

For anyone that’s feeling down: they had an unexpectedly large class (~50ish) last year and knew they would have to have a much smaller class this year even before the news of the potential changes to the NIH. To my knowledge, they only accepted those who applied early (Oct 15th deadline) and a couple of the earliest interviews from January. I was told by an administrator that they would not rescind accepted seats but they would most likely not give out any more spots due to the state of both the university and the country. Just know you were good enough, just a really messy combination of factors to influence how it all shook out.",

Please try to do the same ASAP if they unqualify you (usually comes out a week before selection results) if you believe it was an incorrect decision from them! They can definitely make mistakes as they did in mine, and luckily CS wasn't my first choice. ML was. Best wishes everyone!",

Dear XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX:  On behalf of Dean Lynne Kiorpes and the Graduate School of Arts and Science, I am very pleased to tell you that you have been admitted to the Master of Arts program in Latin American and Caribbean Studies. You may register for the Fall 2025 semester.  We appreciate your application to the Department of Anthropology. While the Department of Anthropology was not able to offer you admission, we very much hope you would consider pursuing a master's in Latin American and Caribbean Studies at NYU's Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS). After a special review of applications, yours was selected by CLACS due to your research interests and profile. We feel that you may be interested in the interdisciplinary master's program in the Center. An MA from CLACS is your next step in furthering a career related to Latin America or the Caribbean, and CLACS alumni have gone on to doctoral programs at NYU, Duke, Princeton, Yale, USC, and UT Austin, among a number of others. Our location in New York City, furthermore, gives you access to one of the most exciting and intellectually stimulating cities in the world.  We regret to add that there are no fellowships or scholarships available to you through the Graduate School or your program. In the Other Resources section of the Admitted Student Resource Page (see link below), you will find information detailing other sources of funding. I encourage you to explore the many options available.",

However, the lack of communication throughout the process left a negative impression. It also seemed they were interested in admitting me but couldn't proceed due to funding issues this year.

After not hearing from the program for well past their posted results timeline I sent a polite email asking for an update or timeline for a decision. They responded with a one sentence email informing me that all admittance letters were sent out on 2/12/25. When I responded asking for clarification since my graduate portal was not updated and my inquiry was not directly addressed, they took two days to respond with a two-word email: “not admitted.” I still have no update on my graduate portal. It seems that the JHU program cannot be bothered to inform people of their decisions and is incapable of showing remorse or grace—an incredibly low bar that is standard amongst every other program. I am deeply disappointed in the program’s handling of this process. If you are still waiting for your results from JHU, don’t expect to hear from them.",

I followed up to ask whether the waitlist had been notified and, by extension, if I was on it. They reiterated that their first-choice admits had been notified but didn’t clarify further. Communication does not seem to be their strong suit.",

FEELS LIKE A SCAM FLR SURE - MOST EXPENSIVE APPLICATION FEE AND I CHECKED WITH PROFESSORS IF THEY HAD FUNDING BEFORE APPLYING, and they ENCOURAGED me to apply. WTF. For future applicants, avoid this school and profrssors in their anthropology department. Liars. And waste of 100 something dollars. Thank fck I’ve got other offers, but feel so bad for people banking on UCSC’s decision.   Here is the BS EMAIL: “I am writing to offer sincere thanks for your application to the Anthropology Ph.D. program at UC Santa Cruz, and to express appreciation for your patience during an unprecedented admissions season.    This admissions cycle began with our typical (somewhat lengthy) multi-stage review process. As mentioned in my last email, in order to give every application the thorough assessment it deserved, close readings were done by faculty members, which were then discussed with sub-field colleagues, who subsequently shared their impressions with our entire admissions committee.  As Chair of the Anthropology Admissions Committee I always find it exciting to learn about the accomplishments and academic goals of our applicants!  However, very late in the cycle, when departments were preparing to submit acceptance nominations to our Graduate Division, admissions deliberations encountered an atypical wrinkle that further lengthened our deliberations. As you are likely aware, uncertainties around the status of Federal grants and contracts for research and education have impacted the admissions postures of many universities. UC Santa Cruz is among the many institutions adjusting to this budgetary uncertainty, and our Graduate Division determined the need to dramatically scale back admissions for fall 2025.   This will make for an exceptionally lean admissions picture for UCSC Anthropology – perhaps the most competitive in our program’s history.  While the UCSC Graduate Division will be sending official decision letters very soon, I wanted to communicate with you personally, to thank you for the time and care you gave your application, and to provide context for the difficult decisions we had to make this year.  Wishing you the very best as you pursue your academic goals”",

I would so greatly appreciate it.  Thank you and GOD BLESS!!!",

My advice for others reading this is to have a clear purpose for what you want to do in the program when applying - (if applicable) write about the struggles you have taken to overcome them and how the program will specifically help you continue to achieve those goals.",

The UC system has some changes in policy that I guess have affected UCLA specifically and hamstrung their admissions process. I don't know when they'll release applications but I hope, like everyone else, it's soon. Just remember that this year's admissions have been marred by the current US government's administration attack on higher education, so this year especially the results aren't indicative of your talents. :)",

The funding situation is also not as solid as they make it seem. while they say everyone is fully funded, by the second year, only a handful of students actually get decent assistantships, it's different from your first year and some end up having to take out loans. On top of that, there’s supposedly an internal ranking system that determines who gets research opportunities, clinical placements, internal scholarships and funding and recommendations.",

Let's not wait until the last minute to make decisions. Help people move off the waitlist before April 15! You only really need to hold onto a couple of offers at your top choices. I would also urge people to accept offers ASAP given the trend of schools rescinding funding guarantees on outstanding offers.

My potential PI asked the graduate admission committee chair and emailed me about this decision. The department has sent the first set of offers at the beginning of this year, so they are currently waiting for those students to accept or decline their offers. It seems that the final decision for us won’t be released until sometime in April since it’s the deadline for people who have been admitted to make the choice. I’m placed on the waitlist because I don’t have a high GPA (3.4/4.0, about average GPA at a top chem B.S. program) & enough research experience (2 yrs of research unrelates to my intended direction + 1 yr of relevant research + 1 relevant publication as the 4th author), just for your reference.",

Due to high competition, not all applicants could be invited for an admission interview. After carefully reviewing your application, we found that your expectations may not fully align with the programme’s focus, and other applicants were a closer match. While AI is an important part of AISS curriculum, our programme covers a broader range of topics and does not include dedicated courses in environmental science, climate change prevention, healthcare, or robotics for healthcare.  Additionally, there may have been technical issues with your submission, such as an overly long motivational video or an incomplete portfolio, which could have affected the evaluation process.  We encourage you to explore programmes that align more closely with your future career aspirations. We sincerely appreciate your interest in AISS and wish you the best of luck with your academic and professional journey!  If you have any questions regarding how or why this decision was made, please contact Kristi Oikimus (kristi.oikimus@tlu.ee)  Kind regards, Admissions team",

I graduated two years ago from a T10 university with a B.Sc. in physics and mathematics with a minor in physical chemistry. Eight years of research experience in high-energy theory and experiment—two at a university while still in high school, four during undergrad, and two more post-graduation. I took two semesters of graduate-level coursework as an undergrad. Spent summers in three NSF REU programs, attended a summer school in high-energy theory, and another in experimental particle physics. Completed a year-long senior thesis on top of my ongoing research at my home university. Published multiple papers, five first author. Presented at three undergraduate research symposia, two mixed symposia, and two major conferences.  Three years as a teaching assistant in undergrad. The last year spent as a physics instructor at a community college. Like an 880 on the PGRE.  This cycle, I changed everything. New essays, a reworked CV, three entirely different recommenders, a new fourth recommender. It didn’t matter. The outcome was the same.  I have no idea what else I could have done. No idea what I’m missing. No idea if there was ever a path forward in the first place, or if I was just clinging to the illusion of one.  Physics doesn’t want me. I get it now.  Good luck to everyone else. If you aren't Vishnu himself you evidently aren't good enough for physics.",

Unlike the other programs (NYU, GATech, UMiami), I couldn't get in contact with any Stanford professors associated with the lab that I was interested in. I've had a few years in the industry after getting an undergraduate degree in Music Technology.",

Last year, we ended up with a very large incoming class of 80 students compared to our target of 60.  Last year we admitted 248 students.  To compensate for last year and to be conservative given the uncertainty in federal funding, we have admitted only 123 out of 1224 applications. In a normal year, nearly all of you would be admitted to our program.  Unfortunately, this is not a normal year.  The reason that we have kept your application active is in case it seems that our entering class will be even smaller than our target.  If that were to occur, we may be able to admit a handful of you.\"",

Cited \"federal funding uncertainty\" and a larger than usual class compared to last year as the main reasons.  email extract: \"You are one of about 50 students who has neither been admitted nor denied admission to the CU Boulder physics Ph.D. program.  Last year, we ended up with a very large incoming class of 80 students compared to our target of 60.  Last year we admitted 248 students.  To compensate for last year and to be conservative given the uncertainty in federal funding, we have admitted only 123 out of 1224 applications. In a normal year, nearly all of you would be admitted to our program.  Unfortunately, this is not a normal year.  The reason that we have kept your application active is in case it seems that our entering class will be even smaller than our target.  If that were to occur, we may be able to admit a handful of you.\"",

I’m sorry I have not sent this email earlier. I wanted to give you an update on your status. You are one of about 50 students who has neither been admitted nor denied admission to the CU Boulder physics Ph.D. program. Last year, we ended up with a very large incoming class of 80 students compared to our target of 60. Last year we admitted 248 students. To compensate for last year and to be conservative given the uncertainty in federal funding, we have admitted only 123 out of 1224 applications. In a normal year, nearly all of you would be admitted to our program. Unfortunately, this is not a normal year. The reason that we have kept your application active is in case it seems that our entering class will be even smaller than our target. If that were to occur, we may be able to admit a handful of you.  In summary, it is very unlikely that you will be admitted to the CU physics Ph.D. program. You should definitely make plans based on not receiving an offer from us. A few of you (out of 50) may end up receiving an offer. We plan to finalize our admissions by April 11.",

While I assure you that the materials you submitted were carefully reviewed by the faculty in the Department of Bioengineering, I regret to inform you the department did not recommend your admission for the upcoming academic year.  The number of admission offers available at Princeton for entering graduate students is extremely limited, and we cannot offer admission to all applicants who are well qualified. Indeed, many departments have applicants who could be admitted if it were possible to accommodate additional students. Our decisions take into account not only the applicants’ merits but also the suitability of the programs to the candidates’ expressed interests. Our goal is to achieve a sound match between the strengths of our programs and the interests of the relatively small number of outstanding students that can be accommodated.  Unfortunately, due to the volume of applications which we receive, it is not possible for the department or the Graduate School to go back and review applications to justify the denial or offer advice on fortifying a future application.  I wish you success in your plans for graduate study and thank you for considering Princeton University.",

There is no interview but my guess is that they do care much more than other MSc. of ETH about extracurriculars and the motivation letter. I was top 20% with a 2.3 german grade (nothing that crazy) from a good German uni (mech. eng.), but I frankly had very good extracurriculars (lots of debate, social sciences engagement, formula student, small fintech internship and teaching assistant of 4 subjects, 4 languages). In terms of work experience, I tend to think that they look for potential rather than CV, since I know people with 1, 2 or 3 years of experience in consulting/engineering who got rejected. Ask yourself why this is the right program for you (and not a MiM at HEC Paris for example) and be able to explain it in a good motivation letter. Also, I believe that for masters there is hundreds of chinese and indian students who apply to European unis, which maybe plays against them all, because there is really not a way to differentiate between the top unis in Asia (moral of the story: try to get a well rounded profile rather than focusing your time during the bachelor in being top 1 of the class).",

Submitted my application in Nov for Dec 1 deadline though Breana didn’t process my application till Dec 15 even after repetitive emails for Toefl waiver which is needed to be administered by her before Dec 1 or else the application remains incomplete and doesn't get processed. In the meantime I also emailed my POI Tiffany A Koszalka, who gave me typical reply of all faculty evaluating process, no interest was shown. On Jan 28 I emailed Huang & Breana, off which Breana replied immediately noting a decision will be made on 15 feb, just after 4 hours I received a rejection notification. Next day Huang replied saying the application is still under review which made me think about what was the final decision. I escalated the issue to the dean about different emails and after that nobody has replied. I came to know from other students that they only prefer their masters students and external students are only invited to inflate the application numbers. I unnecessarily lost my application fee. The department sends another email once they reject the candidate they send another email telling the candidate to get enrolled in their online masters program for 50% scholarship when the candidate has a masters. There is another review written 2 years which says the same thing, everyone please scroll and read.",

We received a very high number of applications and cannot interview the vast majority of the very talented applicants interested in our program. The Admissions Committee carefully reviews each application and chooses a small number who we believe would be the best fit for the Consortium.  While we cannot offer you an interview for the PsyD program, it is clear from our review of your application that you have several valuable training experiences and personal attributes that we believe will serve you well in a career in the mental health field. If you are interested in being considered for one of our other graduate programs please let us know by filling out the survey below. Should additional interview opportunities open up we will reach out directly with more information.”",

I have 5 volunteer experiences with grad/undergrad classes as a translator for assessments, 4 years of work experience in pediatrics ( 6 months as a CSLPA), and very strong LORs from professors/supervisors who know me well. 1 of the LORs was from a professor who is a regarded name in research and an NU alumni. For anyone looking for advice, GPA isn't everything! My cumulative was 3.60, but my major was closer to a 3.2. Use your application to explain why you are passionate to be an SLP, and how NU will assist you in following your passions! The app is 4 questions. That's it. Your answers and LORs are everything. Make sure you build good relationships with professors who can attest to you as a student and as a person. I do not think I would have gotten in if it hadn't been for my LORs. Good luck to everyone in their academic endeavors!",

After carefully reviewing your application, I am sorry to inform you that we are unable to recommend you for admission this year. You should not view this as a reflection on your ability, but rather as a comment on the limited size of our program and the number of applications we received this year.  The process of selecting students for the incoming class is one that our admissions committee takes very seriously. We must make very fine distinctions among highly qualified applicants, many of whom could be successful in our program. Given our small size, this often means having to pass on many impressive, accomplished, and interesting candidates.  Again, I regret that we are not able to offer you admission to our program. We wish you the best in all your endeavors, and hope that you will receive a more favorable decision from another program.",

This year, the Graduate School received over 10,000 applications for our Masters and Ph.D. programs. As you can understand, the selection process for admission to all of our programs is very competitive, and given the nature of graduate study, the number of students admitted to our programs must be severely limited. As a result, the Admissions Committee was forced to make many difficult choices among a pool of highly accomplished applicants.  I would like to assure you that the Admissions Committee gave your application careful consideration; however, we regret to inform you that we are unable to approve your admission to the Ph.D. in Government program for the Fall 2025 semester.  We appreciate your interest in Georgetown University and would like to wish you success in your future academic and career endeavors.  Sincerely,",

Evidently they don't bother informing rejected applicants of their decision until the very last minute. If you haven't heard from UMD, you've almost certainly been rejected.  This is my second year in a row being rejected by every single program I applied to. Graduated a year ago with a BSc in physics and mathematics. Six years of research experience in experimental cosmology (two at a university while in high school, and four during undergrad). Attended one conference, and presented at three undergraduate research symposia. Attended three summer NSF REU programs, one summer school in experimental cosmology, and one summer school in experimental particle physics Worked as a teaching assistant in physics for three years as an undergraduate, and have spent the past year working as a part-time instructor and tutor in physics at the local community college. Contributed to several widely-used open-source software projects made use of in cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy physics (including two CERN packages). Also completed a year-long senior thesis with a professor doing cosmology research at an external institution (in addition to the research I had been conducting at my home institution).   I don't have the slightest clue what went wrong. I significantly revamped my CV and essays this year. I also used three entirely different recommenders. I think this is it for me and physics. Good luck to everyone else.",
