      <div id="bio">
        <div id="left"> I'm originally from Mexico City, but I currently live in Seattle, WA. I've been working in software engineering for over 13 years. I studied Computer Science at Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM). My career path has included roles like software consultant, integration engineer, and for the past six years, I've been managing software engineering teams at an e-commerce company. When I'm not working, I'm spending time with my family – my husband and 19-month-old daughter are my world, and we have four adorable rescue dogs at home. I'm currently working towards a Master's in AI, which has been a great opportunity to update my skills and knowledge in software development. </div>
