** What percentage of entries are from international students (not American or Other) (to two decimal places)?  **
 Answer: [[48.54]] 
 Query Used: SELECT CAST((ROUND ((COUNT(*)*100.0)/ (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Applicants),2)) AS FLOAT) AS Percentage FROM Applicants WHERE US_OR_INTERNATIONAL <> 'American'; 
 Description: This query calculates the percentage of applicants who are not American. It uses a nested SELECT statement to compute the total number of applicants in the database, and compares it to the count of non-American applicants. The outer SELECT performs the calculation: (Count of non-American applicants * 100.0) / (Total applicants) and then rounds it to 2 decimal places. We added a Percetage label to the result 
** What is the average GPA, GRE, GRE V, GRE AW of applicants who provide these metrics? **
 Answer: [[3.71, 266.56, 159.79, 12.09]] 
 Query Used: SELECT CAST(ROUND(AVG(gpa)::NUMERIC, 2) AS FLOAT) as GPA_avg, CAST(ROUND(AVG(gre)::NUMERIC, 2) AS FLOAT) as GRE_avg, CAST(ROUND(AVG(gre_v)::NUMERIC,2) AS FLOAT) as GRE_V_avg, CAST(ROUND(AVG(gre_aw)::NUMERIC,2) AS FLOAT) as GRE_AW_avg FROM Applicants; 
 Description: This query calculates the average of gpa, gre, gre_v, and gre_aw. It uses a SELECT statement with AVG function to compute the results. To keep tow decimals in the response, it used round function to only display 2 decimals. For that to work with average, I cast the result from AVG to NUMERIC.
