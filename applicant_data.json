I had a lot of experience in SLP related areas, but\n\t\t\thad a D in Stats when I first applied. I took another Stats course and got a B that I put down on the\n\t\t\t\"required courses\" section the second time round. In my gap year, I got a job as a Behaviour\n\t\t\tInterventionist, volunteered at a Brain Injury Society doing intake interviews with Brain Injury survivors,\n\t\t\tredid my letter of interest with a Career Advisor, and asked an SLP Alumni from U of A to write my reference\n\t\t\tletter. One of my referees wasn't able to get their reference letter in on time, and they still accepted my\n\t\t\tapplication with just 2 references. If you're applying to U of A for SLP my best advice is to job shadow as\n\t\t\tmany SLPs as you can, try gaining work experience in related fields, and focus on your letter of interest\n\t\t\tand reference letters. Keep trying! If you don't get in this year, you'll probably get in next year!!",
